            <p> Privacy Policy EFFECTIVE DATE November 2017
                The Mix ("The Mix") operates this Web site. The Mix ("we" or "us") recognizes that you care how information about you is used and shared. We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you of our information collection, use and sharing practices for this Web site.
                WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?
                We do not share with others, or sell or rent to others, any personal information that you provide to us through the Web site or through our Customer Service Department, except with your cone third parties to perform services sent or as described in this Privacy Policy. We engag in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, Web site evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We provide personal information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they perform.
                Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered through the platforms, where applicable, through our Customer Service Department in connection with these platforms, and do not necessarily reflect our practices with respect to information gathered through other Web sites that we operate or through other off-line means.
                If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact our Customer Service Department.
                WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED AND STORED?
                We collect and store personal information that you enter into the Web site. For example, when you open an account or place an order, we collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date. This information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this Web site.
                Personal information.  You can visit the Site without submitting any personal information. However, in order to subscribe to our services or use features of our Platforms, you will be required to provide personal information. For example:
                Registration.  In order to use some features of the Platforms, you must first connect another music service account. We collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, email address, telephone number in accordance with our terms of use.
                Facebook.   The Mix may require you to log in through your Facebook account. If you link your Facebook account to a The Mix service, this allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
                Orders.  If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personal information from you on our order form. You must provide personal contact information (such as name, email address, and shipping address) and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date).
                Posted Content.  We enable users to submit additional information that may be made accessible to other users or the general public. To post content, you may be required to first register by providing information such as an email address, display name, and password. Registrants also may choose to voluntarily provide additional information, including an avatar image, a biography, and/or information about their location. And, of course, registrants may disclose personal and other information through their posted content.

                Feedback.  Our online contact form also contains a "message" field through which you may submit additional personal information.

                Surveys, Contests, and Promotions.  From time to time, The Mix may ask users to participate in surveys, contests, or promotions, which may be used to collect both personal and non-personal information. Participation is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose your information.

                Log data.  When you use the Platforms, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser. This may include such data as your IP address, domain name, the pages you visit, the features you use on the Platforms, the date and time of your visit, the files that you download, the URLs from the websites you visit before and after navigating to the Platforms, your software and hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region), and certain cookie information (see below). We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve the Platforms and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.

                Cookies.  We also use cookies in conjunction with the Platforms. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer or other device by your web browser. A cookie allows the Platforms to recognize whether you have visited before and help optimize the shopping experience. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer or device, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer or device. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Platforms may not operate correctly.

                Web beacons.  We also may use an application known as a "web beacon" (also known as a "clear gif" or "web bug"). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.

                Third-party online tracking and behavioral advertising.  We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the personal and non-personal information described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on the Platforms or in email communications from The Mix.

                HOW DOES THE MIX USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
                The Mix uses the information that we collect for a variety of purposes. If we have personal information about you, we may use it, for example: to respond to your questions or requests concerning the Web site; to fulfill the terms of any agreement you have with us; to fulfill your requests for our services and orders for products or otherwise complete a transaction that you initiate; to send you information about our services, the status of any orders, and other topics that are likely to be of interest to you, including newsletters, updates, or other communications; to authenticate billing and identification information; to deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, awards, service-related announcements, and similar operational communications; to improve or personalize your user experience; to improve the quality of our products and services; to comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements; and to manage our business.

                We use the non-personal information that we collect for such purposes as: counting and recognizing users of the Platform; analyzing users’ demographics, interests, and behaviour, including how they use the Platform and various Platform features; improving the Platform and enhancing users’ experiences; researching and creating new products and services or improving our existing products and services; enabling application analytics and research concerning the Platform.

                We also may use the personal and non-personal information that we collect to send you promotions, contests, and surveys. Although we hope you will find our promotional emails of interest, you may opt out of receiving them by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any promotional email.

                If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our products or services, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Platform. This personal information may be used to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at support@The Mix.ca to request that we remove this information from our database.

                WITH WHOM DO YOU SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?
                We share your personal information with other parties for a variety of purposes:

                Analytics and online behavioral advertising. We partner with certain third parties to collect the non-personal information and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, as of the effective date of this Policy, certain of the Sites and Apps use such third party services as Google Analytics, Chartbeat, SimpleReach, Facebook retargeting, and Perfect Audience to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. The Platform also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your non-personal information for use in online behavioral advertising. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Platform to target online ads for The Mix services to you on non-The Mix websites or service.

                Your direct sharing of personal information through third-party websites and services. The Platform may enable you to share directly personal information with websites or online services operated by third parties. For example, The Platform contain a Facebook "like" button, a Twitter "follow" button, or similar features. If you choose to use these features, you may disclose your personal information not just to those third-party websites and services, but also to their users and the public more generally. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by The Mix, we are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal and non-personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy.

                Legal purposes. We also may use or share your personal or non-personal information with third parties when we believe, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary:

                to comply with applicable law or a court order, subpoena, or other legal process;
                to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of our terms and conditions, or situations involving threats to our property or the property or physical safety of any person or third party;
                to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or
                to facilitate the actual or proposed financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets.
                HOW IS MY INFORMATION KEPT SECURE?
                We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to protect personal information that we collect. In order to help protect your personal information further, you should be careful about providing your password to others. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password, please contact info@the-mix.ca

                HOW WILL I BE INFORMED ABOUT CHANGES REGARDING THIS PRIVACY POLICY?
                If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on this Web site notifying users of the changes. In some cases, we also may send an email notifying users of the changes. You should check this Web site periodically to see if any recent changes to this Privacy Policy have occurred.
